Boolean Function Simplifier (Python + Tkinter)

This project is a Boolean Function Simplifier built using Python and the Quine–McCluskey algorithm, with a graphical user interface created using Tkinter.
I originally developed this tool during my second semester to strengthen my understanding of Digital Electronics, improve logic design skills, and enhance my problem-solving ability.

##Features

Simplifies Boolean expressions using the Quine–McCluskey minimization algorithm
Clean and user-friendly Tkinter GUI
Supports binary input for minterms
Generates minimized Boolean expressions
Ideal for beginners learning logic minimization and digital electronics

##About the Algorithm

The Quine–McCluskey algorithm is a tabular logic minimization technique that:

Systematically groups and compares minterms
Eliminates redundant terms
Produces minimal sum-of-products (SOP) form
It is widely used in digital logic design and is a more structured version of Karnaugh Maps.

##Tech Stack

Python 3
Tkinter (for GUI)
Quine–McCluskey Algorithm (core logic)

##Motivation

This project helped me:
Strengthen my Digital Electronics fundamentals
Understand logic minimization techniques deeply
Improve my logical thinking and Python programming
Explore GUI development using Tkinter
